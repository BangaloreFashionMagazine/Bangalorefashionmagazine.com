<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user initially requested a multi-image upload feature for Contest Winners (up to 5 images) and Hero Images (up to 10). Over the course of the session, the user added several more requests:
1.  **Admin Panel Improvements:**
    *   Add a category filter to the All Talents tab.
    *   Show full talent details on the Pending tab before approval.
    *   Fix a bug where the  status was not being saved or displayed correctly.
2.  **Homepage Features:**
    *   Add a Party Updates section below the hero images, manageable from the admin panel.
    *   Remove the black shade/overlay from the hero slider images.
    *   When a Contest Winner image is clicked, it should navigate to the corresponding talent's profile.
3.  **Branding and UX:**
    *   Add a BFM logo that is always visible on every page (in the navbar).
    *   Add the logo as a watermark on all talent images.
    *   Show the logo in a splash screen popup that appears once when a user visits the site. This was later updated to be a quick, 1-second auto-dismissing splash without an Enter button.
4.  **Talent Features:**
    *   Allow talents to upload 1 portfolio video (less than 45 seconds).
    *   Allow talents to upload up to 7 portfolio images (plus 1 profile picture).
    *   Ensure image cropping functionality is available for talents when they upload images.
    *   Confirm that uploaded videos play with their original audio.
5.  **Deployment & Bug Fixes:**
    *   The user experienced significant issues with redeploying the application, with new changes not appearing on the live site.
    *   The user reported that talents were unable to log in on the live site.
    *   The user reported that they could no longer add/delete images or videos for talents in the admin panel on the live site.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a full-stack web application with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend using MongoDB. It serves as a platform for managing and showcasing fashion talents. All the features requested by the user during this session have been implemented in the current workspace's codebase. This includes the party updates section, multi-image uploads, extensive branding (logo, watermarks, splash screen), talent video uploads, and numerous admin panel improvements. However, these changes are not reflected on the user's live deployment due to a persistent deployment issue.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Debugging a set of user-reported issues on their live site:
    1.  Talents are unable to log in.
    2.  The splash screen has reverted to requiring an Enter click.
    3.  Admin is unable to add or delete talent images/videos.
    The agent investigated and concluded that the code in the current workspace is correct and that these are symptoms of the user deploying old code.
-   **Status:** BLOCKED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (The agent verified that talent login and other features work correctly in the local preview environment.)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by the agent is required to guide the user through the correct deployment process. The core problem is not a code bug but a workflow misunderstanding. After a successful deployment, the screenshot tool should be used to verify the fixes on the live site.
-   **User Testing Done:** Y (The user tested their live site and confirmed the features are broken, which initiated the debugging.)

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0): Deployment Mismatch causing live site to run old code.**
-   **Issue 2 (P1): Talent Login is failing on the live site.** (Symptom of Issue 1)
-   **Issue 3 (P1): Admin cannot edit talent images/videos on the live site.** (Symptom of Issue 1)
-   **Issue 4 (P1): Splash screen incorrectly requires an Enter click on the live site.** (Symptom of Issue 1)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1: Deployment Mismatch causing live site to run old code.**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent repeatedly explained that the user's live deployment is linked to the original project (), while all new changes exist in the forked session (). The agent's instructions to deploy from the fork and Replace the existing deployment have been unsuccessful, leading to significant user frustration.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Calmly and clearly reiterate that the live server has old code.
        2.  Provide one simple, step-by-step instruction: In this session (), click **Deploy** -> Select **Replace existing deployment** -> Choose .
        3.  Strongly reassure the user that this will **NOT** cost extra credits.
        4.  If this still fails, propose using the Save to GitHub feature as an alternative to sync the code.
    -   **Why fix this issue?** This is the root cause of all the user's current problems and complaints. Resolving this will push all the completed work to the live application.
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED (Blocked on user successfully performing the correct deployment action.)
    -   **Is recurring issue?** Y
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both. A full regression test of all newly added features is required on the live URL.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None. This issue blocks all others.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no tasks in progress. All development work for the requested features is complete. The current effort is focused on resolving the deployment blocker.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no upcoming or future tasks requested by the user. The priority is to get the completed work live and stable.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. All issues raised by the user have been addressed in the codebase of the current  workspace. The fixes are pending deployment.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
The user has previously faced issues and lost credits during deployment. The confusion between a forked session and the original project's deployment link is a recurring problem.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React.js, TailwindCSS
-   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Deployment:** Containerized deployment to Kubernetes via Emergent's native functionality.
-   **Core Issue:** The workspace is a fork (), but the deployment is linked to the original project (), causing a code mismatch when the user redeploys from the original project.

**key DB schema**
-   **talents:** 
-   **awards:** 
-   **party_events:** 

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the main application logic, including the homepage, admin panel, routing, and all modals. It has been extensively modified.
-   : Manages talent-related API endpoints, including registration, login, and profile updates.
-   : Manages content like awards (contest winners) and party events.
-   : Contains all Pydantic data models for the API.
-   : The talent registration page, updated with video and image cropping.
-   : The talent profile management page, updated for video and image cropping.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The  file is over 5000 lines and acts as a monolith for the frontend. It should be broken down into smaller, more manageable components for the admin panel, homepage sections, and modals to improve maintainability.
-   State management relies heavily on prop drilling. Adopting a state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit would simplify the architecture.

**key api endpoints**
-    (Talent Login)
-    (Admin Login)
-    (Talent Profile Update)
-    (Admin Get Talent Details)
-    (Create Contest Winner)
-    (Create Party Event)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
The absolute highest priority is to resolve the user's deployment issue. The user is extremely frustrated and believes the agent has been wasting their credits and breaking features. You must patiently and clearly guide them to deploy the code from the **current session ()** and use the **Replace existing deployment** option to update their live  deployment. Reassure them this will not cost extra credits. Do not attempt to fix any more code until the user confirms they have successfully deployed the current changes and can see them on their live site. All their recent complaints (login failed, admin edit failed, etc.) are symptoms of the old code being live.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
A sequential summary of the user's recent interactions, highlighting growing frustration:
1.  **Redeployed but changes are missing.** (Issue: Deployment mismatch)
2.  **Contest winner link to profile is broken.** (Status: Fixed in code)
3.  **Admin talent editing is broken.** (Issue: Deployment mismatch)
4.  **Splash screen should be automatic.** (Status: Fixed in code)
5.  **Now talents can't log in.** (Issue: Deployment mismatch)
6.  **Accused agent of wasting credits, wants a refund.** (Status: Acknowledged)
7.  **Insists on an immediate fix for login and a refund.** (Status: Acknowledged)
8.  **Reports the Enter button and admin edit issues are back.** (Issue: Deployment mismatch)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The user's live deployment is critically broken due to running outdated code. Core functionalities like talent login and admin content management are non-operational on the live site.
-   **Mocked:** None.

**3rd Party Integrations**
None.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** The live production environment has multiple severe regressions (login, admin editing, UX changes) because it is running an old version of the code. These are not present in the current development workspace.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin Login:**  / 
-   **Talent Login:**  / 

**What agent forgot to execute**
Initially, the agent implemented video uploads for talents but forgot to add the corresponding video management functionality to the admin panel, which had to be added later after the user pointed it out. The primary failure has been in effectively communicating the deployment process for a forked project, which is the root cause of all current issues and user frustration.</analysis>
